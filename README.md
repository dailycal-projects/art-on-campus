real rudimentary draft w.r.t. css and layout and everything. right now if you open up src/index.html it will allow you to scroll down, and as you scroll to the relevant description the appropriate image will pop up + leafly will transition to a new point on the map. But the layout is all shmucked up and it's not done using the dailycal generator template (I couldn't ever get it running on my computer).
